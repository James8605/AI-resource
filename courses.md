Okay, the user initially asked for post-graduate courses on deep learning, and I provided a list of both university degrees and online certifications. Now they clarified they meant online videos. I need to adjust my response to focus specifically on video-based resources.

First, I should acknowledge their clarification to make sure they feel heard. Then, switch gears from formal courses to video content. They might be looking for free or more flexible learning options, maybe self-paced without the structure of a full course. 

I should categorize the recommendations to make it easier for them to navigate. Maybe free YouTube series, structured video playlists from universities, and hands-on tutorials. Including well-known educators like Andrew Ng or channels like 3Blue1Brown would add credibility. 

Also, need to mention platforms like YouTube, freeCodeCamp, and others where these videos are available. Highlighting key topics each resource covers will help them choose based on their interests. Maybe add some tips on how to use these videos effectively, like taking notes or coding along.

Wait, the user might not want paid content, so focusing on free resources is important. But some platforms like Coursera offer free video access even if certifications are paid. Should I mention that? Maybe note which ones are entirely free versus those with paid options.

Also, including a variety of teaching stylesâ€”theoretical vs. practical, math-heavy vs. application-focusedâ€”could be helpful. They might be at different levels, so organizing from fundamentals to advanced topics makes sense.

I should check if the resources I'm listing are up-to-date, especially in fast-moving fields like deep learning. For example, including content on transformers and LLMs since they're hot topics now.

Finally, end with a friendly offer for further help in case they need more specific recommendations. Keep the tone supportive and encouraging.

### **Tips for Learning**
1. **Code Along**: Pause videos to implement concepts in frameworks like PyTorch/TensorFlow.  
2. **Focus on Playlists**: Stick to structured series (e.g., MIT, Stanford) to avoid fragmentation.  
3. **Join Communities**: Discuss concepts on Reddit (r/learnmachinelearning) or Discord (e.g., Fast.ai).
